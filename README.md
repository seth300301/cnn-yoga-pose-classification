# Classifying Yoga Poses Using CNNs

## Main Responsibilities
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Yoga Pose Classification:
- Developed a CNN model using Keras to recognise yoga poses from 32x32 images and classify the poses of new ones.
- Experimented with regularisation and data augmentation to optimise the CNN model according to accuracy and loss.
- Conducted appropriate error analysis and visualisations to help analyse and deduce why false positive and negatives were being produced.

## Summary
In this project, a convolutional neural network model was built and taught how to classify and distinguish different types of yoga poses based on a 32x32 image. The data sets used include ten different yoga poses with each class having the same number of instances in both training and test sets.
